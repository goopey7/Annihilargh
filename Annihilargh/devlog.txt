Wednesday (2/3/21)
After watching quite a few C++ and WINAPI tutorials. I finally decided to start writing some code in class today.
I have learned/watched videos that should cover pretty much everything I need to implement before getting into DirectX.
I have also learned of some things that DirectX does use such as COM objects and how to use interfaces with them.

Anyways, did a ton of stuff today. I created a really cool wrapper class for creating Windows which nicely encapsulates
all of the nasty WINAPI stuff. I also have implemented a very verbose way to throw exceptions using the WINAPI 
and I have implemented some error checking in my code. I'm not going to error check the stuff that happens before the 
creation of a window because I've never had it fail, and it would be too much time and effort.

Tomorrow or Friday I plan to create a Keyboard class which will act as an interface between the Window class and the 
game engine. The message handler in the Window class deals with input, so we need to give that to the keyboard and
then the game will get key events from the keyboard. Nice encapsulation away from the WINAPI.
