After watching quite a few C++ and WINAPI tutorials. I finally decided to start writing some code in class today.
I have learned/watched videos that should cover pretty much everything I need to implement before getting into DirectX.
I have also learned of some things that DirectX does use such as COM objects and how to use interfaces with them.

Anyways, did a ton of stuff today. I created a really cool wrapper class for creating Windows which nicely encapsulates
all of the nasty WINAPI stuff. I also have implemented a very verbose way to throw exceptions using the WINAPI 
and I have implemented some error checking in my code. I'm not going to error check the stuff that happens before the 
creation of a window because I've never had it fail, and it would be too much time and effort.

Tomorrow or Friday I plan to create a Keyboard class which will act as an interface between the Window class and the 
game engine. The message handler in the Window class deals with input, so we need to give that to the keyboard and
then the game will get key events from the keyboard. Nice encapsulation away from the WINAPI.

Today I created the keyboard class which acts as an interface between the Window class and the rest of the engine.
Next we have to deal with the mouse.

Saturday (2/6/21)
Got a nice mouse class similar to the keyboard class. Also got mouse capturing working. So, if the user drags off 
the client region and doesn't release a mouse button, move events still occur until the mouse buttons are released.
Also dealt with wheel delta. So now all mice are treated equally. So one mouse doesn't scroll faster or slower
than the other.

Tuesday (2/9/21)
Added a class to deal with game logic.
Also, moved the message processing in Annihilargh.cpp over to the Window class

Currently learning a bit about COM (Component Object Model) which DirectX utilizes.
Fortunately Direct3D will do a lot of this for me, so I don't have to become an expert in COM.
Basically COM gives us binary compatibility. Provides us a nice stable interface.
COM is language agnostic. It gives compatibility between different programming languages as well since
it is binary. Has it's own way of resource allocation since it is language independent.
Every COM object has a unique ID. COM objects are interacted with using an interface.
